These include:\n    - Businesses, especially those in the Horeca sector, tend to thrive together. It is therefore relevant to invest in a new business in neighborhoods that are already\n    known, established with other similar businesses.\n    - In a thriving neighborhood, businesses tend to thrive together due to their complementary natures. For instance, restaurants are often found in close proximity to\n    bars, coffeeshops, and shoping streets. It is therefore relevant to have a good idea of what kind of other businesses are present at the targeting neighboorhood,\n    which can help to design the business idea and fit in the overall business landscape."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# Part II: Data description"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "For this assignment, I will use location data from Foursquare to develop insights to support entrepreneurs to choose a neighboorhood for their new horeca business.\nThe data will focus on the city of Toronto, Canada.
